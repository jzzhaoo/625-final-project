## Data Source
- We retrieved our data from Iowa government website data.iowa.gov, which contains the data from Jan. 2012 to Dec. 2021.
- For our analysis, we truncated the sales data from Oct. 2017 to Oct. 2021. The data is more than 2.4 G after truncating. 
- Data is not uploaded on github.

## Code Explanation:
- `Trend and Map` Folder: This folder mainly contains two .RMD files. The .RMD files present the sale trend and sale hot maps.
- `Classification` Folder: There is one .RMD file which conducts individually data cleaning procedures, data correlation analysis, and tries to conduct different classification methods.
- `Report` Folder: In this folder, we have our final report .RMD file and corresponding .pdf file.
