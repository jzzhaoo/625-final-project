# Background

The pandemic of COVID-19 hit the world by surprise in early 2020 and had since left profound impacts to social, economical, and physiological aspects. As a worldwide pandemic that’s not going away anytime soon, it has certainly caused significant changes to public behaviors. Many industries such as airlines, leisure facilities, auto parts, restaurants, and etc. were negatively impacted, so was the alcoholic beverages consumption. But according to the surveillance report from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, alcoholic beverages sales increased while the most sales of food and other drinks decreased during the pandemic of COVID-19. Hence, our group was particularly interested in the economical impacts due to the pandemic. Through investigation on alcohol sales in Iowa, our group tried to figure out economic influences of the pandemic. And we believe that the analysis of the Iowa alcohol sales data provided a good reference to the overall trend in the retail sector. 

# Dataset

The dataset chosen for this analysis is the “Iowa Liquor Sales” data publicly available from the state of Iowa. More specifically, this dataset contains the alcohol purchase records of Iowa Class “E” liquor licensees from January 1, 2012 to current. Class E liquor license, for grocery, liquor, convenience stores, etc., allows the above to sell liquor for off-premises consumption in unopened original containers in a commercial setting. For our analysis, sales data from Oct. 2017 to Oct. 2021 was selected, such as store, brand, sales volume, and sales price, considering data duplication, completion, etc. Overall, more than 9,900,000 observations and 24 variables were evaluated. The dataset is extremely large and intricate. It would be hard to do the analysis on the dataset directly. We need to clean such a large data (more than 2.4G) in different ways for each method, and we need to make sure each function we use works perfectly on our large dataset. In the stage of data processing, we removed data entries with missing values due to the limitation in analytical methods and tried to use vectorization for better performance.
